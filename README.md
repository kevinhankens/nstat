nStat
=====
Overview
--------
nStat is a MVC using a combination of express, jade and mongoose using a custom HTML formbuilder. The mongoose data objects are included in a wrapper object that also contains a form definition keyed by 'type'. CRUD functions as well as paginated lists are generically defined for any data type defined by the wrapper object. 
Status
------
Currently this is in active development, ebbing and flowing through periods of stability. I hope to launch my blog using nStat soon as a testing ground, but realistically it could be used for quickly launching any MVC-type of application.
